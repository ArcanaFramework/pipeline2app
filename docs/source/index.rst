Pipeline2App
============

Pipeline2App is a package for easily wrapping analysis pipelines to container images that
can be run as independent applications, such as `XNAT's container service <https://wiki.xnat.org/container-service/>`_
pipelines and `BIDS apps <https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/>`_ (under development).
It can be used to maintain continuous integration and deployment of pipeline suites (see
`Australian Imaging Service Pipelines <https://github.com/australian-imaging-service/pipelines-core>`_).
